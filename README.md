## Website Functionalities ðŸŽ¯
* We have made a website which has features of rating sites such as IMDb and rotten tomatoes along with its own recommendation feature and Movie analysis page. 

* Our website is equipped with a login page where a user has to enter their username and password or log in through their other social media accounts like twitter, google or Facebook. 

* If a new user encounters our website, then we have a page that directs the user to create a new account. 

* After entering our website, we offer functionalities like rating a movie, reading movie summary, graphs to analyze movies, search engine for movies and also a recommendation engine that recommends movies to watch based on userâ€™s choice.
